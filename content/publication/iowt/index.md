abstract: The scarcity of the planet’s water resources is a concern of several international entities and governments. Smart solutions for water quality monitoring are gaining prominence with advances in communication technology. This work's primary goal is to develop a new online system to monitor and manage water resources, called  Internet of Water Things (IoWT). The proposed system’s objective would be to control and manage raw water resources. Thus, it has developed a platform based on the server-less architecture and Internet of Things Architectural Reference Model, in which it is applied in a simulation environment, considering several electronic devices to validate its performance. For this research, there is a system for capturing raw water from tubular wells. Each well has a level sensor, a temperature sensor and a rain gauge. The data is collected every minute by an electronic device and sent every hour to the IoWT system.  From data analysis, the amount of memory allocated to functions minimally interferes with efficiency. The IoWT system, applied in a real case, consists of connecting a device installed in a water well to the platform, where the data is transmitted through a 3G network and then processed. Thus, the proposed approach has great potential to be considered a complementary tool in monitoring raw water and assisting in decision-making for the management of water resources.
